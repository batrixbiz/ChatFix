              When you just say "Hello" and wait, you're making the conversation take twice as long. 
              The person has to respond to your greeting, then wait for your real question. 
              Instead, include your actual question right away. It's more respectful of everyone's time, 
              and you'll get help faster.

              This isn't about being rude â€” you can still be polite! Just include your question 
              with your greeting so the conversation can move forward immediately.
